Based ideas and some code from Dave Shapiro's [AutoMuse](https://github.com/cbclemmer/AutoMuse_ChatGPT) for chat gpt.

This library creates a separate layer of abstraction from AutoMuse to focus on a chatbot that can have an effectively infinite memory.

An open ai api key and org key are needed to operate the chat bot.

**Warning:** This bot is expensive to run and is not suggested for commercial use as it is probably not efficient enough to be commercially viable.

This is mainly for research purposes.
